- This branch is about adding a menu for a 4x20 LCD display + rotary encoder input mechanism, aiming to have an independent 
printer that can be used without a PC host program.

It is currently in beta, the functionality currently implemented is:
LCD Menu with the following:
- System status page (similar to Marlin/Repetier sysinfo screen)
- Set Extruder/Bed temperatures
- Home machine (all axes)
- Move axis (only 10mm increments supported on X&Y, only 1mm on Z and E) - in progress
- SD File select&print
- SD print pause
- SD print cancel
- Fan menu (to be implemented)
